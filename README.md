# Next-stack

This is a template that I created as I often use this config for web projects that uses NextJS.
It comes with NextJS new App router, and NextUI 2, a UI library.
I added prisma and the base config for i18n to the project, which is a lenghty process that I am getting
bored of doing everytime.

This is for personal use, but feel free to open issues, PR or anything if you are using it.
